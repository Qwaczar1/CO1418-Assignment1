First assignment for CO1418 : Web Technologies
This project includes 4 difrent interconected web-pages. those being the Index.html (aka.Home),
products.html, item.html, and cart.html.
All pages use the same CSS file for styles, and share the same .JS file for functionality.
Products page uses the resources folder and items.csv to generate its contents fully automaticly.

I am not aware of any current bugs present in the code besides possible messed by styleizations for
exceeding thin screens of roughly 220px in width. Or possibly much larger displays as I wasn't
able to test with them.
